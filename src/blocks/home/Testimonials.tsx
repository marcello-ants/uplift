                    Only hours after making my account, Framework was empowering my patients to take an active role in
                    their health while connecting with others on the same journey. Supplementing my appointments with
                    Frameworkâ€™s toolkit of wellness widgets is the best choice I have ever made for my practice.

                    After years of looking for a platform that could give me a closer connection to my audience, I found
                    Framework. My challenge built on Framework has given me a new way of sharing my knowledge that
                    naturally creates a closer, more trusting relationship between me and my audience. Not to mention,
                    the support I receive from the Framework team is incredible.

                    Best of all, I know my challenge is working because Framework gives me the engagement and retention
                    data to prove it. This is the best platform for a private, distraction-free environment to build a
                    supportive, healing community around challenges.
