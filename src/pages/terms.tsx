                            DISPUTE RESOLUTION Binding Arbitration Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this
                            contract, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be
                            referred to and finally resolved by the American Arbitration Association according to their
                            rules, which, as a result of referring to them, are considered as the part of this clause.
                            The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be New York or another location mutually
                            agreed upon by the Parties. The language of the proceedings shall be English. The governing
                            law shall be the substantive law of New York. Restrictions The Parties agree that any
                            arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full
                            extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b)
                            there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or
                            to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
                            to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any
                            other persons. Exceptions to Arbitration The Parties agree that the following Disputes are
                            not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking
                            to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property
                            rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft,
                            piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.
                            If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
                            arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
                            unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within
                            the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
                            jurisdiction of that court.

                            shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the
